The first parameter will be given as the point value. The return value of this function will be used as the identifier.\n- `ifHardLink`: Boolean. If use hard-link to decide connected domains. ( see section `Hard Link` for details )\n\nThe result of invocation of `ConnectedDomain` is a object:\n\n```js\n{\n    domains: [ {}, {}, ... ],\n    totalDomains: 10,\n    groupByIdentifier: {\n        id1: {},\n        id2: {},\n        ...\n    },\n    totalIdentifiers: 5\n}\n```\n\nThe structure of every domain:\n\n```js\n{ \n    bounding: { \n        w: 12, \n        h: 19, \n        x: 0, \n        y: 1\n    }, \n    points: [ { x: 1, y: 2, value: 'a' }, {}, ... ], \n    identifier: 'blue', \n    domainId: 1 \n} \n```\n\n## Hard Link\n\nConnectedDomains use soft-link as default. Below is how soft-link think two domains are connected( all the 0 zones are connected as a domain ):\n\n```\n0011\n0011\n1100\n1100\n```\n\nIf you use hard-link, the upper-left and bottom-right \"0\" zones are not connected, they become 2 separate domains. Below shows how a hard-link connection can be formed:\n\n```\n0011\n0001\n1000\n1100\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"neekey","email":"ni184775761@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-04-23T09:35:29.014Z","created":"2016-04-23T09:35:29.014Z","1.0.0":"2016-04-23T09:35:29.014Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/neekey/connected-domain#readme","keywords":["connected-domain"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/neekey/connected-domain.git"},"author":{"name":"neekey","email":"ni184775761@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/neekey/connected-domain/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"2G03UKNJPCKDEBTMBREIDW2HA\""}
