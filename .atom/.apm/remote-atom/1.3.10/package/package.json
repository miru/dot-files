It transfers files to be edited from remote server using SSH\nport forward and transfers the files back when they are saved.\n\nIf you like it, you could send me some tips via [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=YAPVT8VB6RR9C&lc=US&item_name=tips&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted) or [gratipay](https://gratipay.com/~randy3k/).\n\n\n# Installation\nRemote Atom can easily be installed using the Atom package manager by going to \"Settings > Install\" and searching for remote-atom, or by using the command line:\n\n```\nsudo apm install remote-atom\n```\n\nOn the remote server, we need to install [rmate](https://github.com/aurora/rmate) (this one is the bash version). You don't have to install it if you have been using `rmate` with TextMate or Sublime Text.\nIt is the same executable for TextMate and Sublime Text. If not, it (the bash version) can be installed by running this script (assume that you have the permission),\n\n```bash\ncurl -o /usr/local/bin/rmate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rmate\n```\n\nYou can also rename the command to `ratom`\n\n```\nmv /usr/local/bin/rmate /usr/local/bin/ratom\n```\n\nIf your remote system does not have `bash` (so what else does it have?), there are different versions of `rmate` to choose from:\n\n- The official ruby version: https://github.com/textmate/rmate\n- A bash version: https://github.com/aurora/rmate\n- A perl version: https://github.com/davidolrik/rmate-perl\n- A python version: https://github.com/sclukey/rmate-python\n- A nim version: https://github.com/aurora/rmate-nim\n- A C version: https://github.com/hanklords/rmate.c\n- A node.js version: https://github.com/jrnewell/jmate\n\n# Usage\n\nOpen your Atom application, go to the menu `Packages -> Remote Atom`,\nand click `Start Server`. Your can also launch the server via command palette.\nThe server can also be configured to be launched at startup in the preference.\n\nThen, open an ssh connection to the remote server with remote port forwarded.\nIt can be done by\n\n```bash\nssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@example.com\n```\n\nAfter running the server, you can just open the file on the remote system by\n\n```\nrmate test.txt\n```\n\nIf everything has been setup correctly, your should be able to see the opening file in Atom.\n\n### SSH config\nIt could be tedious to type `-R 52698:localhost:52698` everytime you ssh. To make your\nlife easier, add the following to `~/.ssh/config`,\n\n```\nHost example.com\n    RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698\n    User user\n```\n\nFrom now on, you only have to do `ssh example.com`.\n\n### Known issues\nSince each window of Atom is a separate instance, the tcp server can only be running\non one window. Therefore, file will only be opened in the window with the server running.\nIf that window is closed, the server can be restarted by clicking\n`Packages -> Remote Atom -> Start Server`.\n\n\n# TODO\n- writing tests\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/randy3k/remote-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/randy3k/remote-atom#readme","_id":"remote-atom@1.3.10","_shasum":"b6bca8307daa0f15026bc63fda626e302addd0d7","_resolved":"file:..\\d-116916-13412-11gf34k\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-116916-13412-11gf34k\\package.tgz"}
